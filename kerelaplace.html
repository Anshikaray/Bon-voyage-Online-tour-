<h2><center>ABOUT KERELA</center></h2>
  <h3>    <p class="text-center py-5">Kerala, a state on India's tropical Malabar Coast, has nearly 600km of Arabian Sea shoreline.
 It's known for its palm-lined beaches and backwaters, a network of canals. Inland are the Western Ghats,
 mountains whose slopes support tea, coffee and spice plantations as well as wildlife. National parks like Eravikulam and Periyar,
 plus Wayanad and other sanctuaries, are home to elephants, langur monkeys and tigers.</p></h3>

<p class="text-center p-5">Kochi is by far an exquisite halting destination to unwind amidst its posh environment. 
Touring in Kochi will leave you awestruck from the backwaters to beaches to hill stations; 
this south state radiant’s with jade green glow and staggering palm trees. 
This scenic destination of Kochi is best described as bountiful and beautiful because of its rich flora and fauna 
and you can also visit other beautiful places of the state as well.</p>

Otherwise known as Trivandrum, this city is the capital and presumably the most culturally affluent part of the state.
Trivandrum has played host to a variety of rulers who have all left behind a mark over the city. 
Rapid development has not hindered the unique heritage in the form of the architecture and the culture that is still embodied by the city.
The Kowdiar Palace, which was previously the official residence of the Travancore royal family, is particularly a must-visit in the city.
